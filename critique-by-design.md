# Redesigning "The Rise of LLMs": A Critique by Design

##Overview
This project follows the critique by design methodology to analyze and redesign a data visualization from MakeoverMonday. Through systematic critique, user testing, and iterative design, I aimed to create a more effective visualization that better serves its intended audience and purpose.

## Step one: the visualization
I chose “The Rise and Rise of LLMs” from Makeover Monday because it captures a pivotal moment in the development of large language models—highlighting both how many models have proliferated and how dramatically their parameter sizes have ballooned.

My first impression is that the chart is visually overwhelming: too many colors and overlapping bubbles make it hard to distinguish individual models. The lack of visual hierarchy and clear instructions limits quick understanding.
What does work is the timeline pattern—it clearly shows the surge in model development and parameter growth between 2022 and 2024. Using color to separate companies is a good idea in theory, but in practice, it creates clutter rather than clarity.
The target audience seems to be experts in AI and LLMs, such as researchers, industry professionals, or investors. For them, the chart communicates scale and density of activity, but at the cost of readability. A redesign would benefit from a simpler hierarchy, clearer labeling, and less visual noise.


## Step two: the critique

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution
