# Wireframes / storyboards
I created a high-fidelity storyboard draft directly in Shorthand, building a visual walkthrough of the main elements of my story. This draft integrates the primary data visualizations I developed — line charts, bar charts, flow diagrams, and icon charts — and organizes them into a coherent narrative structure.

By drafting the storyboard in Shorthand, I was able to test the story arc visually, ensuring that transitions felt natural and that each chart supported a clear narrative point. The preview link I provide will allow reviewers to experience this flow interactively.

# User research

## Research Goals
The aim of this study is to explore how target audiences perceive and engage with the storyboard and its data visualizations about online dating apps. The research focuses on **understanding whether the narrative feels relatable, whether the flow is intuitive and easy to follow, and whether the data is perceived as helpful, convincing, and trustworthy**. It also seeks to capture how well the project resonates with participants’ own experiences of using dating apps. Insights gathered from this research will help refine the storytelling to be more engaging, emotionally impactful, and grounded in the lived experiences of users.


## Target Audience
•	Individuals who have used online dating apps (current or past users).
•	Primarily Gen Z and Millennials (18–40), since they represent the largest demographic of dating app users.
•	Secondary audience: peers (classmates, friends) who can give feedback on clarity, design, and storytelling flow even if they’re not active dating app users.

## Recruitment Strategy
Invite classmates, friends, and peers to participate in quick reviews. Share the Shorthand preview link with them so they can view the storyboard interactively.

## Data Collection Method
Interviews (15–20 min each): Semi-structured, open-ended conversations to dive deeper into experiences.

## Interview script & Questions

| Section | Question | Follow-Up / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Experience Context** | Have you used dating apps? Which ones, and how often? | Probe for frequency + specific platforms. |
|  | What words come to mind about your experience? | Capture emotional tone (positive/negative). |
| **2. Resonance with Storyboard** | Does the storyboard reflect your experience? | Ask for concrete examples. |
|  | Did you relate to the burnout/fatigue shown? | Explore personal resonance. |
|  | Which parts felt most accurate or inaccurate? | Note both alignment and disconnects. |
| **3. Clarity & Flow** | Was the story flow easy to follow? | Identify any points of confusion. |
|  | Did the visuals help you understand the message? | Which visuals worked vs. didn’t? |
|  | Any part feel confusing or overwhelming? | Note specific screens/sections. |
| **4. Engagement & Impact** | Did the data/visuals hold your attention? | Flag engaging vs. dull parts. |
|  | Did the story feel convincing and trustworthy? Why/why not? | Probe for credibility factors. |
|  | What would make it more engaging for you? | Gather concrete improvement ideas. |
| **5. Final Reflections** | One-sentence key takeaway? | Listen for accurate message recall. |
|  | Suggestions to improve the overall project? | Ask for specific changes. |


| **P3** | Female, 26. No dating app experience (friends use them) | Could resonate by comparing it to social media (FOMO, swiping like TikTok). Found data convincing (age distribution surprising, gender motivation differences interesting). | Flow was smooth, with clear plots and turning points. | Overall engaging. Suggested improvements: highlight key points in charts; use more consistent one-tone color scheme; replace Fishbone chart with Bubble chart for clarity. | Many people use dating apps heavily and experience burnout — surprising and insightful. |


## Interview Findings

| Section | Participant 1 (Female, 27y) |Participant 2 (Male, 28y) | Participant 3 (Female, 26y) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Experience Context** | Used dating apps (Hinge) |Used dating apps (Tinder, Bumble) | No dating app experience (friends use them) |
| **Resonance with Storyboard** | Related ~50–70%. Burnout & swiping fatigue are accurate. Reason for burnout felt true. Some burnout visuals (heat map) are confusing at first. | Burnout & swiping fatigue are accurate. Reason for burnout felt true. Some burnout visuals (heat map) are confusing at first. | Resonated due to burnout — coped by switching apps or quitting for a while. Related to data on market size and app popularity. Found data convincing (age distribution surprising, gender motivation differences interesting). | 
| **Clarity & Flow** | Story flow was easy to follow with plot points/turning moments. | Visualizations (charts) were engaging. | The graph of Burnout is initially overwhelming but understandable after review. |
| **Engagement & Impact** | Story held attention, felt convincing, and trustworthy. Suggested improvements: make visuals simpler and more relatable for quicker understanding. | Visuals are very helpful, story flow is  engaging. Felt inspired by charts and the story. Impactful overall. Suggested improvements: improve readability and provide more detail in some data.  | Flow was smooth, with clear plots and turning points. Overall engaging. Suggested improvements: highlight key points in charts; use a more consistent one-tone color scheme; replace the Fishbone chart with the Bubble chart for clarity. | 
| **Key Takeaway** | Apps should be used with intention. Burnout is common, reminding users to engage more mindfully. | The story behind the data is impactful and personally relevant. | Many people use dating apps heavily and experience burnout — surprising and insightful. It could resonate by comparing it to social media (FOMO, swiping like TikTok). |

- [3/3] Story convincing



# Identified changes for Part III
| Insight from Research | Actionable Change |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| All participants resonated with burnout (direct or through analogy with social media).  | Simplify charts to highlight **one key takeaway per chart** (e.g., positive vs. negative experience). |
| Story flow was generally smooth and engaging, but some details in some felt a bit cluttered. | Ensure **content alignment and narrative consistency** across storyboard (titles, captions, pacing). |
| Users noted readability issues, overwhelming colors, and suggested using more focused highlights. | Use a **consistent, legible color palette**. Limit chart colors and only highlight **positive vs. negative** where relevant. |
| Fishbone chart was confusing; the bubble chart was suggested as an alternative. Some charts are engaging (User experience), but too much color reduces clarity. | Replace **Fishbone chart with Bubble chart** for easier understanding. Simplify comparison charts by only highlighting key differences. |
| Users found the story impactful, but engagement drops when charts are too dense. | Make visuals **reader-friendly**: emphasize one insight per chart, highlight meaningful contrasts, reduce noise. |


## Key Design Principles for Next Iteration
1. **One Key Insight per Chart** → Focus on a single, memorable takeaway (positive vs. negative).  
2. **Consistency in Content** → Align layout, titles, and visual style across storyboard.  
3. **Readable & Accessible Visuals** → Use limited colors; highlight only what matters.  
4. **Thoughtful Chart Selection** → Replace complex charts with more intuitive options.  
5. **Balance Data + Story** → Keep narrative flow strong while simplifying data for quick comprehension.
