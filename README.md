# TSWD-portfolio-templates
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference:

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About Me

Hi, I'm **Christy**  

I'm a master's student in the **MIIPS program at Carnegie Mellon University**.  
With a background in both **engineering** and **art**, I’ve grown into a **UI/UX designer** who loves exploring the intersection of **technology and design**.  

I believe that great design happens when complex technology is translated into experiences that feel **human, intuitive, and meaningful**. My goal is to deepen my ability to bridge this gap — turning ideas and innovations into designs that empower people. 


# What I hope to learn

In **Telling Stories with Data**, I want to strengthen my ability to:  

- Visualize and interpret data with clarity and accuracy  
- Differentiate between effective and ineffective charts  
- Use narrative techniques to guide audiences through insights  
- Apply visualization methods to real-world UX and product design cases  

As a designer, I believe data visualization is more than just making charts. It’s about **telling a story**. A well-crafted chart can highlight patterns, uncover meaning, and support decisions in ways raw numbers cannot. My goal is to learn how to design visuals that are not only accurate but also **engaging, intuitive, and human-centered**, so that data becomes a tool for understanding and action.

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images
<img src="https://www.cmu.edu/brand/brand-guidelines/images/lettermark-600x600.jpg" alt="Online Image" width="600"/>
### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
